### Chapter 1: Introduction
- Monolithic apps are easier to deploy, but harder to maintain over time and
sometimes impossible to scale.
- Microservices-based application architectures allow easier development of each
component, but are harder to deploy and configure to work as a single system.
- Linux containers provide much the same benefits as virtual machines, but are
far more lightweight and allow for much better hardware utilization.
- Docker improved on existing Linux container technologies by allowing easier and
faster provisioning of containerized apps together with their OS environments.
- Kubernetes exposes the whole datacenter as a single computational resource
for running applications.
- Developers can deploy apps through Kubernetes without assistance from
sysadmins.
- Sysadmins can sleep better by having Kubernetes deal with failed nodes automatically.
