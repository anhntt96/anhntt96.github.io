  -  ~/.bashrc file: alias k=kubectl
- List and inspect Nodes, Pods, Services, and ReplicationControllers in a Kubernetes cluster
  - kubectl cluster-info
  - kubectl get nodes
  - kubectl get pods
  - kubectl get services
  - kubectl get svc
  - kubectl get replicationcontrollers
  - kubectl get rc
- Run a container in Kubernetes and make it accessible from outside the cluster

  - kubectl scale
- Access the web-based Kubernetes dashboard on Minikube
